# hello-world
This repository is for my course assignment
I am a junior at UNCC and a Computer Science major. I have never used github before so this is a good learning experience for me.
My favorite exercise activity is swimming but i also enjoy running. C++ and Java are the coding languages i am most comfortable with.
